Inheritance in java:
    This is mechanism in java through which one class can acquire the properties
    and methods from another class. The class from which we acquire the properties is called
    parent/superclass/baseclass and the class which acquire the properties and methods is called
    Child class/ derived class/ subclass.
Advantages:
    1) Code duplication is reduced.
    2) Saves Memory
    3) execution time is less
Disadvantages:
    Classes get tightly coupled. If we change some in the parent class it will affect all the
    children classes, and we have to make sure that this new change is compatible wiht the code
    that we have in the children classes.
When we should use Inheritance:
    if there is a case in which we would have to use the same methods in many
    classes and the classes are closely related to each other the best practice would be
    to create a parent class and use it to extend the methods
    into the subclasses. for example Cat class and Dog Class.

Types of Inheritance:
    we have 4 types of inheritance 1) single 2)hierarchical 3) multilevel 4) multiple

Single inheritance:
    In Single inheritance we have only one parent and only one child class.
Class Animal{
String name;
String color;
int age;
double weight;
}

class Dog extends Animal{
}

Hierarchical inheritance:
    In Hierarchical we have only one parent class and multiple children classes.
    for example the Object class in JDK
class Animal{
String name;
String color;
int age;
double weight;
}

class Dog extends Animal{
}

class Cat extends Animal{
}
Multilevel Inheritance:
    If we have one parent and one child class and many intermediate classes it is called multilevel
    inheritance
    CEO-->Manager-->Assisst Manager--> Senior Employee-->Junior Employee
class Human{
String name;

}
class Employee extends Human{
String employeeId;
}
class Teacher extends Employee{
String subjects
}
Multiple Inheritance:
in Multiple Inheritance we have a single child class and multiple parent classes: This is not
supported in java with classes but possible with the help of interfaces.
class Display{
int resolution;

}
class Keyboard{
int noOfKeys
}
class Laptop extends Display,Keyboard{
}
Rules:
    1) Private members are not inherited (private fields and private methods)
    2) Constructors don't participate in inheritance
    3) if we have constructor in the parent class we must have a matching constructor in the
    children classes as well.
    4) in Java a subclass can only extend single parent class.
